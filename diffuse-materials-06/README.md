## Diffuse materials

Now we will produce some more realistic images with ray bounces. Let us say that we want our sphere to be made of some kind of material that diffuses light. The ray that hits such a sphere will bounce of it's surface and change direction in random way. In order to achieve that we want our bounced ray to start at the point of intersection of the first ray with the sphere with the direction drawn form certain distribution. We sample points from unit ball to serve us as direction vectors. So if `p` is a point of intersection of the original ray with a sphere, `c` is it's center and `x` is sampled point then we send the bounced ray in the direction of `p-c+x`. With this randomization sometimes ray can hit the object by which it was reflected. To avoid such a situation we set `t_min=0.0001` for hit detection. Moreover let us assume that half of the light is absorbed every time it hits a sphere to make proper shading. Some image viewers assume that images were gamma corrected before they were saved so our produced image can appear a bit dark. If that is the case uncomment line `col = vec3( sqrt(col[0]), sqrt(col[1]), sqrt(col[2]));`.

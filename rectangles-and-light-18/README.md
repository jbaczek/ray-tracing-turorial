For there is a lot of noise when taking narrow light sources (lambretian scatteres rays randomly and camera also sends them non deterministically) to provide decent uniformicity of an image we have to tune parameter `ns` (number of rays sent through one pixel). Also image can be quite dark when maximum emittance is set to `(1,1,1)`, so we can also tune this. Any value above 255 will be capped at 255 (I suppose), maximal saturation of a channel. Another parameter we can use to tune brightness level is ppm's format cap value (default at 255).

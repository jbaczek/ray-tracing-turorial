## Dielectirc

Some materials neither absorb rays nor reflect them. Instead they let rays pass through them behaving like lens. Tracing rays in materials like this requires a lot of math. Read [this article](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/docs/2006--degreve--reflection_refraction.pdf) to get all the necessay knowledge to understand what are Snell law, reflection, refraction and what is a reflectance. Code in this example is a bit messy but it works in this configuration :)

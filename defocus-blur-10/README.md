## Positionable camera

Now we will allow our camera to change position and zoom in. Zooming in is easy - it is sufficient to make the plane on which we project rays smaller when keeping a number of rays the same. We achieve this by doing simple trigonometry. Positioning is a bit more complicated. First we need to define position of camera in space (the origin) and direction where camera is pointing. The direction vector gives us a line connecting camera with the center of the field of view. We can still look at the same direction but have our camera tilted so the one last thing to define is "which way is up". Then we do some simple linear algebra to align our FOV with the camera position. Taking cross product twice with the direction vector ensures that resulting vectors are perpendicular to the direction vector and relative to each other.
